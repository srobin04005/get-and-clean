==================================================================

This dataset was derived from experiments that were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

The result set (tidy.txt) for this analysis represents only the mean and standard deviation observations aggregated for each activity, by subject. 

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md': This file

- 'CODEBOOK.md' :  Description of process and variables 

- 'run_analysis.R':  R source file that is used to obtain data and process datasets

- 'tidy.txt':  tidy dataset of merged data from test.txt and train.txt, averaged as an aggregate for each subject and activity.

Notes: 
======
- 'train/Inertial Signals' files from the original study were not used in this analysis 
- 'test and train' data were merged to create results
